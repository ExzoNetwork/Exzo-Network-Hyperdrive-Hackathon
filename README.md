#### Jumpstart your next project on Exzo Network & join the fastest growing ecosystem in crypto

- Hackathon dates: September 25 - December 30th, 2023
- Type: Online and global
- Project Submission Form: [Official Website](@#)

## Introduction

Exzo Network is a fast, low-fee, and censorship-resistant blockchain designed to enable builders to quickly deploy and scale applications to billions of users globally. The Exzo Network Foundation is excited to host its 3rd virtual hackathon focused on allowing developers to experiment and leverage the Exzo Network blockchain to create a plethora of projects spanning DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs, and Web3.

As long as you have an Internet connection, you're invited to join the global hackathon! In addition, if you are located in China, Eastern Europe (CIS region), India, Vietnam, Africa, or Brazil, you're eligible for regional prizes (see prize tracks below). While participants are encouraged to build novel crypto apps, hackers can build infrastructure or any tool they believe will have an impact on the Exzo Network ecosystem. The only requirement is that teams must incorporate Exzo Network into their project in some way. Take a look at this list of [hackathon project ideas](https://github.com/Exzo Network-labs/Exzo Network-season/blob/master/ideas.md).

Throughout the registration period and hackathon, there will be live-streamed presentations, workshops, and panels on a variety of crypto-related topics. See the full schedule here, and make sure to join a few sessions on Twitch!

## Submissions

A submission form will be availble around October 1st. It will require a description of the project, project logo/image, a list of teammates, project name, a link to the GitHub /gitlab repo, and a slide deck or video presentation.

## Judging

Participants may submit a maximum of 1 project by the hackathon deadline. Once all submissions are collected, Exzo Network will distribute a list to the judges for the evaluation process. Teams and individuals are evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Functionality
2. Potential impact
3. Novelty
4. Design + UX
5. Composability

After judges complete individual evaluations, the hackathon organizers will discuss with the judges to choose the winners based on the project's weighted scores. Winners of the event will be announced shortly after the end of the hackathon.

There are 3 global prize tracks: DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. There will be a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winner in each of those categories. In addition, there are sponsored prizes by supporting projects including Serum, Kin, Raydium, and Pyth for teams that best integrate with their respective technologies. And finally, as mentioned above, there are regional prize pools for teams submitting from China, Eastern Europe, India, Africa, Vietnam, and Brazil.

The project submission form will be published on or about June 1. It will require projects to provide a brief description of the project, a logo/image, a list of teammates, the project name, a link to the GitHub /gitlab repo, and a slide deck or video presentation.

## Prizes

All prize amounts will be distributed in USDC-SPL.

## Legal Disclaimer

The Exzo Network Season Hackathon is a competition where projects will be evaluated by judges on their technological merits without consideration of legal viability. Participants in the Hackathon will create software solely for purposes of evaluation by judges as part of a competition and not for commercial deployment or release as part of the Hackathon.All participants must comply with applicable laws and regulations when releasing any software that they develop as part of the Hackathon.

The Hackathon ideas and developer resources that Exzo Network Foundation (“SF”) provides are for educational and inspirational purposes only. SF does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment of any such applications in violation of applicable laws or regulations. SF does not encourage, induce or sanction the deployment, integration or use of any such applications (including the code comprising the Exzo Network blockchain protocol) in violation of applicable laws or regulations and hereby prohibits any such deployment, integration or use. This includes use of any such applications by the reader (a) in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, (b) if the reader is located in or ordinarily resident in a country or territory subject to comprehensive sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), (c) if the reader is or is working on behalf of a Specially Designated National (SDN) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions, or (d) in violation of the Commodities and Exchange Act.

The reader should be aware that U.S. export control and sanctions laws prohibit U.S. persons (and other persons that are subject to such laws) from transacting with persons in certain countries and territories or that are on the SDN list. As a project based primarily on open-source software, it is possible that such sanctioned persons may nevertheless bypass prohibitions, obtain the code comprising the Exzo Network blockchain protocol (or other project code or applications) and deploy, integrate, or otherwise use it. Accordingly, there is a risk to individuals that other persons using the Exzo Network blockchain protocol may be sanctioned persons and that transactions with such persons would be a violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions law. This risk applies to individuals, organizations, and other ecosystem participants that deploy, integrate, or use the Exzo Network blockchain protocol code directly (e.g., as a node operator), and individuals that transact on the Exzo Network blockchain through light clients, third party interfaces, and/or wallet software.
